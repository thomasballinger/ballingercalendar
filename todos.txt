Integration with PNL Task Tracker:
-create task (create ticket as well)
-when ticket reassigned, removed?  No.

New Database:
id
whose
name (matches task tracker)
description (matches task tracker)
duedate (remove this field)
priority (now 1-5)
estimatedtime = 

Don't seek integration with old events!
create good record of time up until this Friday, save it, then start using new system

use cases:
-record time spend on task
-create new task
-report time spend working
-report time spend working on what tickets





Before attempting web interface:
-calendarHours needs method to get hours for several ids at once
-calendarHours should use this method for faster getWeekHours
-createTasks already works correctly for web interface


Once trying to do web interface:
-authentication methods need to be different
-should more flexibly be able to switch out authentication;
  getClient type methods?
