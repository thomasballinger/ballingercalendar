Before attempting web interface:
-test how retrieving long calendar feeds works.
  If can't get over 50 events (reasonable max for a week) then
  can't use for getWeekHours.
-Also check out limits for google spreadsheet list feed; should
  we stop using grab all events type things?
-calendarHours needs method to get hours for several ids at once
-calendarHours should use this method for faster getWeekHours
-createTasks already works correctly for web interface


Once trying to do web interface:
-authentication methods need to be different
-should more flexibly be able to switch out authentication;
  getClient type methods?
