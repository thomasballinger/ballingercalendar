Before attempting web interface:
-calendarHours needs method to get hours for several ids at once
-calendarHours should use this method for faster getWeekHours
-createTasks already works correctly for web interface


Once trying to do web interface:
-authentication methods need to be different
-should more flexibly be able to switch out authentication;
  getClient type methods?
